**Winter Letter Delivery DX**

A platformer made by Ashton Gallistel. Deliver a letter to a family of snowman!

Made with a Phaser 3 code framework for creating a bare-bones 2D platformer game.

Visual and auditory assets provided by Kenny Assets [Pixel Platformer](https://kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer) asset pack, with gratitude. The exceptions to this are the sprites for the moon and letters, which were made by me.
